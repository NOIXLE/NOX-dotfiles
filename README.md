### WARNING: These settings are very customized for my setup and will require a decent amount of changes to work in your system. READ EVERY CONF FILE AND EVERY SCRIPT ADDED.

Dotfiles for **Hyprland running on Arch Linux** (btw)

Hi! This setup is mostly based on Catppuccin Mocha (The blue accent variant when available)
As such, some programs will not have their configuration included in these dotfiles (look up the respective theme for the app you want)

[Catppuccin ports Website](https://catppuccin.com/ports/)

I want to point out the projects that helped make my rice possible:

- Cava/music player waybar module (modified to work in multiple monitors and clear junk files)
  - [PROXY's Dots](https://github.com/PROxZIMA/.dotfiles/tree/master)
- Music player volume control script (for waybar module)
  - [HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE)
- Hyprland animations
  - [ML4W Hyprland Dotfiles](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles)
 
(App specific themes and wallpapers, NOT INCLUDED IN DOTFILES):
- Steam theme
  - [Adwaita for Steam](https://github.com/tkashkin/Adwaita-for-Steam)
- PaintTool SAI 2 Theming mod (not free)
  - [sai2S by Primu](https://ko-fi.com/s/e72022686f)
